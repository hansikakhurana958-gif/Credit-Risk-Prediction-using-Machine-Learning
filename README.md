This project was built using customer credit risk data sourced from Kaggle, with the objective of developing a machine learning model for predicting defaults and creating an interactive dashboard for visualization and decision support.
The dataset contains various customer attributes such as BAD (indicator of default status, where 1= default and 0= non-default), LOAN (loan amount), MORTDUE (amount due on existing mortgage), VALUE (value of the property), REASON (purpose of the loan, e.g., Home Improvement or Debt Consolidation), JOB (employment category), YOJ (years on the job), DEROG (number of major derogatory reports), DELINQ (number of delinquent credit lines), CLAGE (age of the oldest credit line in months), NINQ (number of recent credit inquiries), CLNO (number of credit lines), and DEBTINC (debt-to-income ratio). These variables provided a comprehensive view of the customer’s creditworthiness and were used as input features for model training.
The methodology began with data preprocessing and cleaning. Categorical variables such as REASON and JOB were first converted to character type, missing values were imputed with "Unknown", and then they were converted back to factor type to prepare them for machine learning models. This ensured that both the training (credit) and new (new customers) datasets had consistent encoding for categorical features. Missing values, if any, were handled, and the dataset was structured for modelling. The cleaned data was then processed in R Studio, where the machine learning pipeline was implemented.
For predictive modelling, the XG Boost algorithm was chosen due to its robustness and efficiency in handling structured tabular data. The model was trained on a subset of the dataset and evaluated on test data to assess predictive performance. The evaluation metrics demonstrated strong results, with the model achieving accuracy of 90%, precision of 96%, recall of 91%, and an F1 score of 93%. These results indicate that the model was highly effective at identifying defaults while balancing false positives and false negatives.
The output of the model, including predicted values and performance metrics, was then exported and integrated into Power BI. In Power BI, an interactive dashboard was created to display the results. The dashboard contains a confusion matrix, along with slicers that allow users to filter by customer type (new or existing) and by individual customer ID. A key feature of the dashboard is that it has been built to automatically update whenever new customer data is added, ensuring real-time reflection of updated predictions and insights.
The dashboard interpretation highlights how financial institutions can leverage such tools for risk assessment. For instance, by selecting specific customers, decision-makers can immediately view predicted default status and understand the associated risk. The confusion matrix provides a quick visual of the model’s predictive success across different categories, further validating the reliability of the model.
In conclusion, this project integrates machine learning with business intelligence tools, demonstrating how advanced models like XG Boost, when paired with interactive visualization in Power BI, can provide actionable insights for credit risk management.
