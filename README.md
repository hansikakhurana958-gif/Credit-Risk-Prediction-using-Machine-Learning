# Credit-Risk-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
I built and validated an XG Boost-based credit risk model in R on 5,965 customer records, evaluating performance using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and confusion matrix. The model automated risk scoring for new applicants and integrated probability of default, risk score, and risk levels into Power BI dashboards.
